# 1. Combine Two Tables

**Table: Person**
```
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| personId    | int     |
| lastName    | varchar |
| firstName   | varchar |
```
**personId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.**
**This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.**

**Table: Address**

```
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| addressId   | int     |
| personId    | int     |
| city        | varchar |
| state       | varchar |
```

**AddressId is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.**
**Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.**


**Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table.**
**If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.**

**The result format is in the following example.**

**Input: Person table:**
```
| personId | lastName | firstName |
+----------+----------+-----------+
| 1        | Wang     | Allen     |
| 2        | Alice    | Bob       |
```

**Address table:**
```
| addressId | personId | city          | state      |
+-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| 1         | 2        | New York City | New York   |
| 2         | 3        | Leetcode      | California |
```

**Output:**
```

| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| Allen     | Wang     | Null          | Null     |
| Bob       | Alice    | New York City | New York |
```

# Explanation: 
There is no address in the address table for the personId = 1 so we return null in their city and state.
addressId = 1 contains information about the address of personId = 2.

---
```sql
Create table Person (personId int, firstName varchar(255), lastName varchar(255))
Create table Address (addressId int, personId int, city varchar(255), state varchar(255))
Truncate table Person
insert into Person (personId, lastName, firstName) values ('1', 'Wang', 'Allen')
insert into Person (personId, lastName, firstName) values ('2', 'Alice', 'Bob')
Truncate table Address
insert into Address (addressId, personId, city, state) values ('1', '2', 'New York City', 'New York')
insert into Address (addressId, personId, city, state) values ('2', '3', 'Leetcode', 'California')
```

# 2. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
---
**Table: Employee**
```
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |
```

**Id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.**
**Each row of this table indicates the ID of an employee, their name, salary, and the ID of their manager.**

---

**Write a solution to find the employees who earn more than their managers.**

The result format is in the following example.

**Input:**
**Employee table:**
```
| id | name  | salary | managerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | Null      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | Null      |
```

**Output:**
```
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
```

# Explanation: Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.

```sql
Create table Employee (id int, name varchar(255), salary int, managerId int)
Truncate table Employee
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, managerId) values ('1', 'Joe', '70000', '3')
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, managerId) values ('2', 'Henry', '80000', '4')
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, managerId) values ('3', 'Sam', '60000', NULL)
insert into Employee (id, name, salary, managerId) values ('4', 'Max', '90000', NULL)
```

# 3. Duplicate Emails
```
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
```


**Id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.**
**Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.**

---

**Write a solution to report all the duplicate emails. Note that it''s guaranteed that the email field is not NULL.**

**The result format is in the following example.**

---
 
**Input:**
**Person table:**
```
| id | email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
```

**Output:**
```
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
```

# Explanation: a@b.com is repeated two times.


-----------------------------------------------------

Create table If Not Exists Person (id int, email varchar(255))
Truncate table Person
insert into Person (id, email) values ('1', 'a@b.com')
insert into Person (id, email) values ('2', 'c@d.com')
insert into Person (id, email) values ('3', 'a@b.com')


---

# 4. Delete Duplicate Emails

**Table: Person**
```
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
```

**Id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.**
**Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.**
 

**Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.**

**Please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.**



After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table.
The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table.
The final order of the Person table does not matter.

The result format is in the following example.
---

**Input:**
**Person table:**
```
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
```

**Output:**

```
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
```
# Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.



---

# 5. Find those parents who has only girls.
**Return Parent Name only.**
```sql
CREATE TABLE boys (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    ParentName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE girls (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    ParentName VARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO boys (Id, name, ParentName) 
VALUES 
(1, 'John', 'Michael'),  
(2, 'David', 'James'),   
(3, 'Alex', 'Robert'),   
(4, 'Luke', 'Michael'),  
(5, 'Ethan', 'David'),    
(6, 'Mason', 'George');  


INSERT INTO girls (Id, name, ParentName) 
VALUES 
(1, 'Emma', 'Mike'),  
(2, 'Olivia', 'James'),  
(3, 'Ava', 'Robert'),    
(4, 'Sophia', 'Mike'),  
(5, 'Mia', 'John'),      
(6, 'Isabella', 'Emily'),
(7, 'Charlotte', 'George');
```

# 6. Total over 50 and least
**Find total Sales amount for the orders which weights more than 50 for each customer along with their least weight.(from TSQL2012 database, Sales.Orders Table)**

**You can find tsql2012 database in here: https://gist.github.com/alejotima/cac70484db23834591b142ad07e79e67**

# 7. Carts

**You have the tables below, write a query to get the expected output**

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Cart1;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Cart2;
GO

CREATE TABLE Cart1
(
Item  VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY
);
GO

CREATE TABLE Cart2
(
Item  VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY
);
GO

INSERT INTO Cart1 (Item) VALUES
('Sugar'),('Bread'),('Juice'),('Soda'),('Flour');
GO

INSERT INTO Cart2 (Item) VALUES
('Sugar'),('Bread'),('Butter'),('Cheese'),('Fruit');
GO
```


**Expected Output.**

```
| Item Cart 1 | Item Cart 2 |  
|-------------|-------------|  
| Sugar       | Sugar       | 
| Bread       | Bread       |  
| Juice       |             |  
| Soda        |             |  
| Flour       |             |

**Table: Orders**
```
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
